This project aims to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather data. Using machine learning techniques, we've built a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline and predictive model to forecast rainfall with high accuracy.

Key Objectives:

Clean and preprocess raw weather data

Handle missing values and outliers

Engineer meaningful features

Balance the dataset to address class imbalance

Build and evaluate predictive models

Provide date-specific predictions for practical use
